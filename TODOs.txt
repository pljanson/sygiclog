for 2.0.0 

road map
2.0.0 I am Moving to Qt, so porbably no new C# version.
  There might be a last C# improvement as trial for Qt C++ code.
  
  If so I need to look into unit test concurrency, locking testfiles. 
  
  Posisble extentions are:
  - move xml generation into classes instead of file writes.
  - add GPX track viewer  
  
current
1.5.0 final
    test with latest Sygic 14.7.4 logs
    
rc3 tzc added, GPXext tests added
rc2 v time fixed, tzc removed
rc1
	v cleanup code (fxcop stylecop)
	. manual to github wiki
	
beta 1
	v check last Sygic version 13.4.1 logfiles (version 5)
	v Program.cs Thanks to Lars TODO
	v unit tests for versions 2,3,4,5
	v validate the gpx files on the map
    v in GIT
	
for 1.4.0 find out about gpx timezone settings and put them in the file.

TZC time zone correction parsing
LogParserSettings -> toXMLComment() ToString() for loggin into the output files.

Every version:
- check version numbers in assembly and string
- build output files (exe & zip)
- update webpage / manual
